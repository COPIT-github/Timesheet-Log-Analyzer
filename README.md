# Timesheet Log Analyzer
This Project is built for University of Houston College of Pharmacy.
https://www.uh.edu/pharmacy/

This tool automates the process of extracting data from the raw TA log sheets that are submitted by over 30 teaching assistants throughout a semester. 
The tool then generates various metrics that can be used by professors and college stakeholders to gain insights into the performance and workload of the TAs. 

These metrics includes information such as 

<li>Total number of hours worked by each TA</li>
<li>Total number of hours worked by each Professor</li>
<li>Total number of course hours for each course</li>
<li> Time spent by TA on each type of task in each course: that include attendance taking, assisting professor..etc in each course</li>
<li> These Metrics are generated with different levels of detail TA, Professor level, Course level, Department level</li>

<br>
By analyzing this data, professors and college stakeholders can identify areas for improvement and optimize the educational experience for students.
